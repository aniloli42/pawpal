**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
  - The initial UML design includes four classes: `Owner`, `Pet`, `Task`, and `Schedule`. An `Owner` holds a daily time budget and a list of pets. Each `Pet` holds a list of care `Task` objects. The `Schedule` class takes an owner and a pet, selects tasks that fit within the owner's time budget (sorted by priority), and stores both the chosen tasks and the ones that were skipped.

- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?
  - **Owner** — stores owner info and daily available time; manages a list of pets.
  - **Pet** — stores pet info and manages a list of care tasks.
  - **Task** — represents a single care activity with a title, duration, priority, and category.
  - **Schedule** — acts as the planner; reads the owner's time budget, selects and orders tasks by priority, and explains why tasks were included or skipped.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
    - Yes
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.
    - **Added unique IDs to every object.** The initial design had no `id` field on any class. Without IDs, removing or looking up a specific pet or task by name would cause conflicts when two objects share the same name (e.g. two pets named "Max"). Adding a UUID to each class solved this cleanly.
    - **Added get-by-ID methods to every class.** Once we had IDs, we needed a way to retrieve a specific entry without scanning everything manually. Each class now has a `get_pet(pet_id)`, `get_task(task_id)`, etc. method so lookups are consistent and encapsulated.
    - **Added foreign key reference IDs.** `Pet` stores `pet_id`, `Task` stores `pet_id`, and `Schedule` stores `pet_id`. This lets each object know which parent it belongs to without holding a full object reference, making serialization and lookups simpler.
    - **Moved task creation to Owner, not Pet.** Originally the design had task management methods on `Pet`. But since tasks must be created with the correct `pet_id` set, it made more sense for `Owner` to be the factory — it knows which pets it has, so it can set the FK correctly and then delegate storage to `Pet.add_task()`.
    - **Extracted a Scheduler class (SOLID — SRP + OCP).** The original `Schedule` class was responsible for both storing the result and running the scheduling algorithm. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle. We extracted a separate `Scheduler` class whose only job is to run the algorithm and return a `Schedule`. This also makes it easy to swap in a different scheduling strategy later without touching `Schedule` at all.
    - **Schedule became a pure result container.** After extracting `Scheduler`, `Schedule` no longer has `generate()` or `available_tasks` as inputs. It only stores the output (scheduled tasks, skipped tasks, total duration) and provides `explain()` and `to_dict()`. This makes it clean and focused.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?
